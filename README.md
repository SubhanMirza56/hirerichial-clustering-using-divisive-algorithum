# hirerichial-clustering-using-divisive-algorithum
Divisive clustering is a top-down hierarchical method that starts with all data in one cluster and recursively splits it into smaller clusters. Splitting continues until a stopping condition is met, such as reaching a desired number of clusters or minimum cluster size.
